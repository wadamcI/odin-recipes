    <h1>MASA-D Recipes</h1>
    <p> Every year, the team travels to one of the southern states in America to compete in the <strong> International Rocket
        Engineering Competition </strong> (IREC), consisting of approximately <strong> 30 participants</strong>  with varying
        tastes, allergies, religions, and other dietary preferences or restrictions.
    </p>
        The competition lasts <strong>five days</strong>. While the first one or two are spent inside a temperature-controlled
        environment, the latter part takes place predominantly in the desert.
    <p>
        As the culmination of a year’s work, the competition serves as a prime <strong>team-building exercise</strong>.
        The challenges strengthen bonds, victories are celebrated together, and failures foster a determination for improvement that uplifts team spirit.
    </p>
        Therefore, nutrition becomes a task of utmost importance. It must not only ease competitors into heat
        acclimatization and fuel the exhaustion of trekking through the desert, but also provide the comfort of a warm mother’s embrace after the stresses of the environment.
    <p>
        It is with the core belief that <em> a bad day can be saved by a good meal, but not the other way around,</em>
        that this ever-evolving repository of recipes and methods is written: <em> as a guide to a successful competition. </em>
    </p>

        <li>Hunger is the finest seasoning.</li>
        <li>The cook’s patience is essential; the crowd’s impatience is a ticking time bomb.</li>
        <li>A recipe is a suggestion; tasting is the only way to be sure.</li>
        <li>Given enough prep time, even Batman can beat anyone.</li>
